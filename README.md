# Haskell/GPipe examples for

## Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming

These are ports of the examples from *Jason L. McKesson*'s wonderful online book [Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming](http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/) from **C++** and **GLSL** into **Haskell**. The ports use *Tobias Bexelius*' OpenGL framework [**GPipe** [1]](https://github.com/tobbebex/GPipe) [[2]](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GPipe) to express OpenGL buffers, uniforms, vertex shaders, and fragment shaders in normal Haskell code.

It is recommended to use a diff tool to compare each code example with the next. The ports have been written to minimize changes between tutorials, therefore diffing them will highlight many of the essential changes required by each lesson.

The tutorials are set up for use with `cabal`'s `build`, `configure`, and `clean` commands.

* Tutorials 1-6 are complete and resemble Jason's examples.
* Tutorials 7-17 are forthcoming.
