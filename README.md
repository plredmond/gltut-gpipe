# Haskell/GPipe examples for

## Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming

These are ports of the examples from *Jason L. McKesson*'s wonderful online book [Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming](https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/gltut/wiki/Home) from **C++** and **GLSL** into **Haskell**. The ports use *Tobias Bexelius*' OpenGL framework [**GPipe** [1]](https://github.com/tobbebex/GPipe) [[2]](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GPipe) to express OpenGL buffers, uniforms, vertex shaders, and fragment shaders in normal Haskell code.

### Usage

It is recommended to use a diff tool to compare each code example with the next. The ports have been written to minimize changes between tutorials, therefore diffing them will highlight many of the essential changes required by each lesson.

### Installation

The tutorials are set up to build with `cabal`. A few of the tutorials need to read data files at runtime, which requires that you `cabal install` install them.

#### 1. Prep your haskell environment

Install the haskell-platform `2013.2.0.0` from <https://www.haskell.org/platform/prior.html>.

```sh
cabal install cabal-install-1.18.0.4 # because the 1.2x.x.x versions don't work

# set your $PATH to use ~/.cabal/bin or ~/Library/Haskell/bin
# according to where cabal 1.16 installed cabal 1.18
```

If you're using Mac OSX 10.9 or see anything clang-related when you do `gcc --version` then you'll need to tell GHC to use the real gcc or OpenGLRaw won't install. It's a one-line change in a configuration file detailed [in this issue comment](https://github.com/haskell-opengl/OpenGLRaw/issues/18#issuecomment-41755745).

#### 2. Build all the tutorials

Read `build.sh` or do:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plredmond/gltut_haskell-gpipe/master/build.sh
sh -x build.sh
```

Run executables like:

```sh
$ gltut/pkg/bin/tut1
```

There are multiple demos in most of the tutorials.

### Status

* Tutorials 1-6 are complete and resemble Jason's examples.
* Tutorials 7-17 are forthcoming.
